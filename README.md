## Hi, I'm Voy!
I do these things:
- Create C# Scripts and Projects for the Unity Game Engine
  - Mostly Editor Scripts Geared Towards Software Development Kits and Content Creation Kits for various Social VR Games such as [ChilloutVR](https://chilloutvr.net), [VRChat](https://vrchat.com), and [PoligonVR](poligonvr.com)
- Create Unity Shaders via [Amplify Shader Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570)

A Majority of what I create is licensed under The MIT License, although some of my repos may not be, check the indivudal repos for the license and whatever is listed as the license holds true. If any of my Repos lack a License and are not a Fork of an existing repo then you may assume it is licensed under the MIT License unless otherwise stated. I'm not cool with weird licenses!
